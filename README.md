# INTERESTING ABOUT ME

I won an Accolade International Award in San Diego California by entering a professional videography contest. I showcased my best work in wedding story, highlighting my creative vision and storytelling abilities.

I love to travel and have visited 11 countries, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Barcelona, Portugal, Vienna and now in Canada but I am here to study. Cheers!
